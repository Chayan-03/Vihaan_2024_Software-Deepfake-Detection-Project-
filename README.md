# DeepFake Detection

## Description

This project aims to develop a machine learning model capable of detecting deepfake videos. Deepfake detection is crucial in today's digital age to combat the spread of manipulated media.

The model is built using machine learning techniques and trained on labeled datasets for deepfake detection. It utilizes computer vision algorithms to identify visual anomalies and discrepancies indicative of manipulated media.
